# Hi I am Aubin, 
# IT professional in the washington, D.C. metro area.

I combine technical and interpersonal skills to create solutions that improve lives. During my recent exploration of emerging technologies, I uncovered a profound passion for Data Analytics. I am excited to merge this passion with Cybersecurity to excel as an IT professional. I'm always up to learning new tech! I am looking for work or interesting projects to collaborate on, so don't hesitate to reach out.
