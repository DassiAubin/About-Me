Hi I am Aubin, I combine technical and interpersonal skills to create solutions that improve lives. A versatile and detail-oriented IT professional with an additional skillset in data analytics, I have a deep interest in ed tech and natural language processing. I'm always up to learning new tech! I am looking for work or interesting projects to collaborate on, so don't hesitate to reach out.

ðŸŒ±   Check out my projects.
ðŸ“«   Connect via any of my social media accounts.
ðŸ’¡   During my downtime, I travel as much as possible, listen to podcasts, pick up new hobbies like cross stitching, play video games, rock climb, and nerd out at a weekly D&D session.
